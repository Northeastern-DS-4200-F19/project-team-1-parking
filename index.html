			<h1>Project Team #1: Parking, DS 4200 F19</h1>
			<p><strong> Title: A day's worth of parking in Chester Square</strong>
				<p>

					<p><strong>Brian Fogarty</strong>, <strong> Ysabelle Kempe</strong>, <strong>Lal Birali</strong>, <strong>Victoria Yang</strong></p>

					<p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/ds4200-f19/">DS 4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cody.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Prof. Cody
							Dunne</a>, <a href="https://visualization.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Data Visualization @ Khoury</a>, <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>.</p>


					<h1>Motivation</h1>

					<p> This project was developed in conjunction with the Chester Square Neighborhood
						Association. The goal of the Neighborhood Association is to show that there is a problem with
						parking availability and distribution in the area. Residents are often unable to find
						parking close to their homes, and there are complaints of inefficient parking practices.</p>
					<p> The Neighborhood Association wants to bring the problem of parking to the
						attention of local government. The Association already knows there is a problem
						and is able to explain the issue and potential causes in words (e.g., not
						enough parking, residents donâ€™t know where to park, etc.), but they want to
						be able to show numbers that prove their point. </p>
					<p> We hope this project serves as a valuable tool for the Neighborhood Association
						to communicate the need for change to authorities. Cars are a key player in daily
						urban life, and parking needs to be taken seriously in order to create
						a better standard of living for those on both sides of Chester Square.</p>
					<p> When designing our project, we asked ourselves how occupied Chester Square parking
						is throughout the day. We wanted our final piece to show change over time, as well as give users
						an idea of how difficult it is to find parking at any given time. Through our own research
						and data collection, we have concluded that a reasonable response would be
						to more clearly mark parking spots, as well as conduct another survey.</p>

					<h1>Visualization</h1>

					<p>Here is our final visualization. Use the slider to select the time of day shown.

			<h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

			<p>Our visualization includes an interactive map showing occupancy rate, as well
				a bar chart that shows the empty and occupied parking spots on each street.
				The user is able to use a slider to change the time of day, which is reflected in the
				visualizations.</p>
			<p>For our map, we used color to represent occupancy rate. We used a color scale of
				red, white, and green because we believed it was intuitive for red to mean that there
				are less spots available and green to mean there are more spots available. We designed
				the map to only show streets because we didn't want to clutter the visualizations with buildings or other landmarks.</p>
			<p>We included the bar chart as well because it is very important for a user
				not only to know the proportion of spots filled, but to know exactly how many
				spots are left. We used a simple stacked bar chart to show this data, which uses area to
				show the parking capacity of a certain street, as well as area and color to show the breakdown of
				empty versus occupied spots.</p>
			<p> For interactivity, users can use the slider to update both visualizations, as well as hover over the
			 bar chart for more detailed information on the number of empty and occupied spots.</p>
			<p>Below, you can see screenshots of our final visualization.</p>

			<h1>Data Analysis</h1>

			<p>Our data was collected during a parking survey conducted in Chester Square from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Oct. 29, 2019.</P>
			<p>Filled spots, empty spots, and blocked spots were recorded by hand on the hour.
				We filled this data into a Google Sheet by hand. This original Google Sheet
				included each spot with a unique id number (integer), the street (string),
				and the parking status for each spot throughout each hour of the data collection.
				If a car was parked in a spot, we used the first three characters of the license plate (string).
				If the spot was blocked, we used "blocked". If there was construction blocking the spot, we
				used the value "construction". If there was simply no car parked in the spot, we did not include a value in that cell.</p>
			<p> For the bar chart data, we used Python to clean and preprocess. We iterated through
				the data and aggregated the number of occupied spots and full capacity for each street.
				The final data has street name as a string, occupied spots as an integer, and capacity as an integer for each time of day.</p>
			<p>For the map data, we also used Python with the NumPy and Pandas libraries to clean and preprocess.
				The output was a csv file with polygon coordinates (floats), occupancy
				counts (integers), occupancy rates (floats), and percentages (floats).</p>

			<p>This task table shows that our main goal is to understand how the occupancy
				rates fluctuate throughout the day. It is also to understand problem areas for parking.
				What are the areas that most frequently have no available spaces? By understanding
				where the problem areas are and what time of the day issues arise, we can help the Neighborhood
				Association prioritize certain areas for improvement.</p>
			<p>The final results of our project are geared toward presentation and discovery. We want
				the Association to be able to take this visualization and present its findings to
				community members or local government figures. In order to achieve our task goals, we
				knew this visualization had to be simple, uncluttered, and easily understood by individuals without a data science background.
				We wanted it to tell the story of a day of parking in Chester Square, which is partially why we used the recognizable shape
				of Chester Square in our map.</p>
			<p>Our top two tasks both had to do with identifying and browsing, so we decided to create a visualization
				that would answer both of those questions. We abstracted these tasks together to create the new
				task goal of understanding the number/roportion of free spots throughout the day.</p>

			<h1>Design Process</h1>
			<p>Below, you can see our initial visualization draft. Originally, we had imagined
				the color scale as red, yellow, and green. Spatial position is one of the most valuable
				encodings in data visualization, and we wanted to use a map to show where exactly the
				problem areas are for parking. We simplified the map down to just streets (rather than
				including landmarks and buildings) because we wanted to avoid chart clutter. In this
				original sketch, we imagined that the bar chart on the bottom would show the number of available
				spots in the area at each hour. We did this because we wanted our vis to be very practical and usable
				in the goal of showing people how easy it is to find parking at a specific time. Color coding on this
				bar chart would have corresponded to the color scale for the map, with green meaning more spots are available
				and red meaning less spots are available. A slider in this sketch controls the time of day currently shown on the map.
				For each selected time of day, that bar on the bar chart would have been highlighted. </p>
			<img src="Brian_Viz1.jpeg" alt="First visualization sketch" style="width:700px;height:600px;">
			<p>Our next visualization sketch, shown below, was done digitally using Tableau and
				Adobe Illustrator. We made a few very substantial changes in this iteration. One of these
				changes was to alter our color scale from red, yellow, and green to red, white, and green.
				We belive that this color scale is more intuitive because some people may not associate
				yellow with a midpoint between green and red. White is more neutral. We toyed with
				the idea of showing individual cars on our map rather than occupancy rates, but
				we decided against it because we wanted to keep the vis simple enough for users
				to gain a broader main takeaway.
				We altered our bar chart to a stacked bar chart that shows the number
				of occupied and empty spots for each street, rather than for each time of day.
				As the slider updates the time shown on the map, the stacked bar chart also updates.
				This makes our visualization more information-dense without too much added complexity.
				We nixed color on the bar chart because we did not feel it was intuitive to have the same
				color scale for both visualization portions since they are showing different aspects of our
				data. We added a filter option for users to choose which types of regulation spots they
				wanted to see. This would help make the visualization customizable, more granular, and show varying
				levels of complexity.</p>
			<img src="digitalvissketch.png" alt="Second visualization sketch" style="width:700px;height:600px;">
			<p>Our final visualization contains our planned map and bar chart, with the slider to update time of day.
			One aspect of our plan that we were not able to implement due to time constraints was filtering based on regulation.
			However, we still believe that this visualization gives a good overview of a day of parking in Chester Square. </p>
			<p>Unfortunately, our group was unable to take part in the in-class usability testing.
				In fact, we hit quite a few roadblocks to creating our final product. Due to time constraints,
				we were forced to kill our darlings. In other words, we had to cut some features of the
				visualization that, given more time, we would have included.
			</p>

			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Parking is an extraordinarily important part of urban life. It allows people
				to own cars and have greater freedom of transportation. But, especially in a
				city like Boston, real estate is incredibly valuable and cars take up
				a lot of space. </p>
			<p> This parking survey and the following vis was designed to identify
				parking problem areas in Chester Square, analyze how efficiently people park, and
				prompt ideas for improving parking in the neighborhood. When we began this project,
				none of us had any experience with parking analysis or parking surveys, but throughout
				the course of this project we began to understand how bad parking or bad parking spot
				design can have resonating effects on the layout of a neighborhood. Parking availability
				can vastly effect quality of life for residents because it could mean the difference
				between going straight home after a long day at work or having to trudge for 10 minutes
				in the cold darkness to get home.</p>
			<p> Through our experiences walking around Chester Square, as well as our data
				analysis, we discovered that there are parking issues in the neighborhood. There
				were many people who parked very far away from eachother, but did not leave enough
				space for another car to park. A suggestion we have is for local government to
				add painted parking spots onto the street so that people are directed to park more
				efficiently. </p>
			<p>For further analysis, we would also recommend a follow-up parking survey
				be performed on a day with more ideal conditions. We were forced to work on a
				rainy day when there was construction, which skewed our results. </p>
